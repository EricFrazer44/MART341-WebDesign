<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> 
    The Martian is a science fiction novel that tells the story of an ansronaut<br />
    named Mark Watney who is taking part in a manned mission on the planet Mars.<br />
    After a terrible storm forces the crew to evacuate, Watney is injured and left<br />
    behind. After the rest of the crew is long gone, Watney wakes up to find he is<br />
    stranded alone on the planet.<br />
</p>
<p>
    This book does an incredible job of following Mark on his journey through the use<br />
    of personal log entries that recount the day, as well as jumps to the perspective of<br />
    NASA officals and the rest of the crew. The explanations of the science behind each<br />
    challenge Mark faces are easy to follow and interesting in many parts of the book.<br />

<p>
    This is easily the most exciting and enjoyable book I have read in my life, and this<br />
    is the reason I find myself coming back to it time and time again. If you like the<br />
    science-fiction genre, then this book is an exceptional piece of work that I would<br />
    highly recommend.<br />
