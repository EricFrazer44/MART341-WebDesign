<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> 
    The Martian is a science fiction novel that tells the story of an ansronaut
    named Mark Watney who is taking part in a manned mission on the planet Mars.
    After a terrible storm forces the crew to evacuate, Watney is injured and left 
    behind. After the rest of the crew is long gone, Watney wakes up to find he is stranded
    alone on the planet.

    This book does an incredible job of following Mark on his journey through the use
    of personal log entries that recount the day, as well as jumps to the perspective of
    NASA officals and the rest of the crew. The explanations of the science behind each
    challenge Mark faces is easy to follow and interesting in many parts of the book.

    This is easily the most exciting and enjoyable book I have read in life, and is the reason
    I find myself coming back to it time and time again. If you like the science-fiction genre, then
    this book is an exceptional piece of work that I would highly recommend.
